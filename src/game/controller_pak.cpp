// Controller Pak (N64 memory card) filesystem internals N64Recomp's
// built-in `ignored_funcs` list expects some runtime to provide under a
// `_recomp` suffix, but stock N64ModernRuntime doesn't implement -- see
// stock_runtime_compat.cpp's file-level comment for the full context, and
// STATUS.md round 23 for how this was found.
//
// These are libultra's low-level pak internals. The game reaches them only
// through the osPfs*/osMotor* entry points, which are replaced at a higher
// level -- src/game/controller_pak_hle.cpp emulates the Controller Pak file
// API and the runtime handles the Rumble Pak -- so nothing below should run.
// Each just fails the way a missing pak would.

// familiarity with the publicly-documented N64 controller pak address CRC,
// not a checked reference) -- low risk either way since nothing here
// reports a real pak connected, but revisit this specific function first
